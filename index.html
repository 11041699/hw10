        <h2>A Day In The Life</h2>
        <p>
            I read the news today, oh boy <br>
            About a lucky man who made the grade <br>
            And though the news was rather sad <br>
            Well, I just had to laugh<br>
            I saw the photograph<br>
            He blew his mind out in a car<br>
            He didn't notice that the lights had changed<br>
            A crowd of people stood and stared<br>
            They'd seen his face before<br>
            Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords<br>
            I saw a film today, oh boy<br>
            The English Army had just won the war<br>
            A crowd of people turned away<br>
            But I just had to look<br>
            Having read the book<br>
            I'd love to turn you on<br>
            Woke up, fell out of bed<br>
            Dragged a comb across my head<br>
            Found my way downstairs and drank a cup<br>
            And looking up, I noticed I was late<br>
            Found my coat and grabbed my hat<br>
            Made the bus in seconds flat<br>
            Found my way upstairs and had a smoke<br>
            And somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>
            I read the news today, oh boy<br>
            Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
            And though the holes were rather small<br>
            They had to count them all<br>
            Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall<br>
            I'd love to turn you on

        <h2>When I'm Sixty-Four</h2>
        <p>
            When I get older losing my hair<br>
            Many years from now<br>
            Will you still be sending me a Valentine<br>
            Birthday greetings bottle of wine<br>
            If I'd been out till quarter to three<br>
            Would you lock the door<br>
            Will you still need me, will you still feed me<br>
            When I'm sixty-four<br>
            You'll be older too<br>
            And if you say the word<br>
            I could stay with you<br>
            I could be handy, mending a fuse<br>
            When your lights have gone<br>
            You can knit a sweater by the fireside<br>
            Sunday mornings go for a ride<br>
            Doing the garden, digging the weeds<br>
            Who could ask for more<br>
            Will you still need me, will you still feed me<br>
            When I'm sixty-four<br>
            Every summer we can rent a cottage<br>
            In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear<br>
            We shall scrimp and save<br>
            Grandchildren on your knee<br>
            Vera, Chuck and Dave<br>
            Send me a postcard, drop me a line<br>
            Stating point of view<br>
            Indicate precisely what you mean to say<br>
            Yours sincerely, wasting away<br>
            Give me your answer, fill in a form<br>
            Mine for evermore<br>
            Will you still need me, will you still feed me<br>
            When I'm sixty-four
